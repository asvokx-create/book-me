  ["1. Marketplace role", "BubsBookings is a marketplace that helps customers find and book independent providers. It does not employ providers, perform their work, guarantee a provider’s identity, qualifications, safety, availability, legality, or results, or replace a customer’s own judgment."],
  ["2. What BubsBookings checks", "BubsBookings uses account-email verification, agreement acceptance, profile and listing completeness, location and pricing fields, and automated content screening. These checks can help identify incomplete or suspicious submissions, but they are not a criminal background check, professional-license verification, insurance verification, business-registration verification, or endorsement."],
  ["3. What Stripe handles", "New providers must complete BubsBookings’ Stripe-hosted document check confirming they are at least 18 before a listing can be public, a booking can be accepted, or a payout can be sent, as well as required Stripe payout onboarding. BubsBookings receives the resulting eligibility and readiness statuses, not identity documents or a full date of birth. A provider profile that existed before this requirement was introduced may receive a documented administrator exception after review; that exception is not a Stripe Identity result or a broader safety guarantee. Stripe Connect payout onboarding and the separate age check have different purposes."],
  ["4. What providers remain responsible for", "Providers are responsible for all required licenses, permits, registrations, insurance, bonds, training, vehicles, workers, tax obligations, and safe lawful performance of their services. Providers must accurately describe their experience, availability, price, service area, cancellation terms, and any credentials they choose to state."],
  ["5. What customers should confirm", "Before booking, review the provider’s listing, price, cancellation terms, and communication. For a service where credentials, insurance, permits, references, or special safety precautions matter, ask the provider for appropriate evidence and make an independent decision. Do not share passwords, alarm codes, full card numbers, government identifiers, or unnecessary health information."],
  ["6. Reports and urgent safety concerns", <><p>Report suspicious, unsafe, fraudulent, or abusive conduct through the booking, conversation, or <Link href="/support" className="font-bold underline">support</Link> process. BubsBookings can investigate, restrict content or accounts, and preserve relevant records. For an immediate threat or emergency, contact 911 or the appropriate emergency service first.</p></>],
